<p>The Wizardlab is a labor of love. I started the  multi-machine vagrant
project as a way to practice the art of System Administration in a public
manner.</p>
<p>I use the Wizardlab as starting point when I decide to embark on a mission to
install/configure a new service or application.</p>

<h2>Bill’s take on Hypervisors<a class="headerlink" href="#bill-s-take-on-hypervisors" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Hypervisors are one of my favorite tools. A hypervisor takes a computer and
divides up the resources for multiple virtual systems to use (VMs).</p>

<h2>Bill’s Ansible Adventure<a class="headerlink" href="#bill-s-ansible-adventure" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ansible is the Python-driven cross-platform automation solution from Redhat.
The scripts for Ansible is done in yaml, and the tool imports variables from
files that it parses in the directory structure.</p>
<p>Ansible parses a host inventory file, and will dynamically assign
configuration based on properties of the host it targets. Groups of hosts
can be assigned and nested to create practically anything.</p>

<h2>My DevOps Story<a class="headerlink" href="#my-devops-story" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>I fell in love with DevOps through the instructor training coursework that
I took during my tenure as an IT teacher. Before taking the instructor
training coursework for Cisco DevNet, I had been studying Cisco CCNA, Linux, and Python as separate topics.</p>
<p>DevOps brought all of these concepts together, and the experience of
practicing all these skills at once was thrilling.</p>
<p>On my lab equipment, I was free to use whatever technology that I saw best fit
the job. I had a lot of desktop boxes, but most of they were from circa 2008,
and storage devices were mostly 200GB of spinning rust.</p>
<p>The nice production workstations had to run Windows, and I would have a device
get kicked out of the network if I configured any kind of firewall exception.
We had to join production systems to the production Active Directory, and I had
zero acccess to managing Domain Group policy. Everything had to be done by
hand, with a USB drive.</p>
<p>I needed to submit paperwork for every piece of software I installed, and wait
for a TAC technician to test the software (I waited up to a year for software
testing). Over 100 sites are supported by this single group of techs, so any
kind of question-mark raised during testing would often mean it would need to
sit for a while.</p>
<p>My students needed System Administration experience, so I designed a VDI
solution that I hosted on premises. I ran my own AD, so I could support VMware
and demonstrate datacenter concepts. All lab equipment was on an isolated
network with its own internet connection, and I routed traffic over the
internet to providde access to the Lab equipment from the production
workstations.</p>
<p>I created this whole VDI system before I systematically studied Linux, or
Networking. Building the whole system up was a process of brute force problem
solving. DevOps methodology and tooling makes building and maintaining systems
easier.</p>
<p>I realized that I would need to work in a larger scale environment to exercise
my new skillset, and I set my mind on finding a role as a System Administrator
instead of teaching. I spent six months training as a maniac, and it paid off.</p>
<p>In my current work, I am learning how to manage Windows workstations using
Linux, Ansible, Gitlab CI/CD, Powershell, and Chocolatey.</p>
