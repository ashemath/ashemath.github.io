# Bill the Wizard's Take on Generative AI
Our society is going through a watershed moment: the rise of general
purpose AI that will be able to do practically anything. Technical,
creative, managerial, culinary, agricultural, transportation, construction,
maintenance, communication, every sector of our society will be
impacted.

It doesn't matter what the work is, the technologies we are developing
is going to enable organizations able to do more with less people
working for them.

## Think about the Horses
Prior to the invention of automobiles, there were a
lot more horses in the United States. People stopped buying horses
because they could buy a machine that did comparable work.

The industrial revolution accelerated the scaling up of infrastructure
to support cars, trains, and automobiles. Capital driven industry
capitalized on scientific progress, hard won through generations of
scientists pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the
natural world. 

Gas was cheap and plentiful. As transportation technology improved, less
horses were bred for transporting people and goods. In the year 2024,
you only see horses when you drive through rural areas where people
keep horses for pleasure riding, herding cattle, or competing in rodeos.
Maybe you'll see horses in a parade, or at a State fair. There's
still horses, but a lot less of them. The horses we do keep
are special, or lucky to be important to someone.

## Post General AI Society
Right now we are experiencing just a taste of the impact AI will
have on human industry, education, and society. AI
Models like ChatGPT, StableDiffusion, and alike are able to generate
value for organizations that would take Humans minutes, days, hours,
or months. StableDiffusion can pump out art that might take weeks to
create by a skills graphic artist. That analysis of hundreds of
records can be done in minutes insteads of taking a team of people
weeks.

What's been made public is only a primitive, pared down, and optimized
for scale version of what corporations funding these projects have access
to. It takes 10's of millions of dollars to develop these models, so
academia is largely unable to drive the devvelopment of these tools.

Profit driven industry holds all the cards when it comes to the development
of AI. Hiring less people means more profit. Jobs are evaporating
before our eyes, and our academic programs are facing a societal challenge
that shakes, to the core, the very nature of what we value from
education.

## Nothing to Do
If AI can do my homework for me, make writing a paper easier, or
create that art that I want, I can have more time to just consume media.
AI is already replacing administrative staff, graphic artists, engineers,
journalists, paralegals, medical assistants, billing specialists, cybersecurity
professionals.
Large corporations with access to these technologies downsize their workforce, one
role at a time, or they let wages languish as the economy inflates, and they feel
free to not replace people when they leave because productivity levels are
so easy to maintain.
All you will need is a C-Suite, a pile of computers, and a skeleton crew of
DevOps people to connect services across the globe. Fully automated factories will
employ some human beings, but just a small fraction of the people who would have
been necessary to staff that scale of operation in the 1990's.
