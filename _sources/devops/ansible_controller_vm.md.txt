# Ansible Controller VM
NOTE: This project is under development, and will be release soon.
## What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open source project backed by Redhat. The product has a 
wide range of applications. Ansible can help automate anything that you would want to do with a computer: software testing, infrastructure configuration (Servers, Clients, Services, Network Devices), compliance and auditing, workload deployment.

Ansible is "agentless," and it's built on top of SSH. If you can SSH a thing, you can probably automate it with Ansible.

## Practice Makes Perfect
A tool is only valuable when you understand how to use it effectively. Automating system configuration (Configuration Management) with Ansible might 
require a variety of modules, connection methods, and design decisions.

deploys an Ansible Controller Virtual Machine, desktop and development environment included.

## Requirements
- 64-bit Linux or Windows Host
- 20-40GB+ Disk Space (Varies with use)
- 8+GB RAM (Hypervisors love RAM)

## The Vagrantfile
Vagrant works with a variety of so-called "provisioners (AWS, Azure, etc.)
and local machine hypervisors which they call "providers" (Virtualbox, VMware,
VirtualBox, etc). The Vagrantfile contains instructions for building the VM. 
This Vagrantfile is designed to work with two providers:
- VirtualBox
- libvirtd (Combined with virt-manager)

## What's included in the Vagrantfile
- Controller VM and Target built on Rocky 9 64-bit.
- 32GB Disk and 4096MB RAM for the Controller VM
- 16GB Disk and 2048MB RAM for the Target VM
- Ready to use Python virtual environment for Ansible
