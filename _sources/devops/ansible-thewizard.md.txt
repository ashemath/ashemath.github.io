# Ansible Roles and "The Wizard"
Ansible's role features are really helpful for creating reusable chunks of
configuration.

I wanted to create a fun context for exploring roles, so I built this
little project that debugs Black Sabbath's "The Wizard".

## Try it out

### Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/ashemath/ansible-thewizard`

### Install ansible
You can install ansible in a Python venv with the provided script:

`./setup_ansible`

Activate your the installed venv by running `source bin/activate`
This will add the venv's packages to your PATH variable until you run
`deactivate`. 

Alternatively, you could use system-level ansible. This project
uses only core ansible functionality.

### Run the playbook
`ansible-playbook apply_roles.yml`


## The design
### "The Wizard"
The song has three verses and a chorus that repeats after each verse.
The chorus changes on the 2nd iteration, and stays that way for the
3rd.

We'll be using task, variable, and meta main.yml files. Here's the `tree`
of the folder structure:

```
roles/
├── role_a
│   ├── tasks
│   │   ├── chorus.yml
│   │   └── main.yml
│   └── vars
│       └── main.yml
├── role_b
│   ├── meta
│   │   └── main.yml
│   ├── tasks
│   │   └── main.yml
│   └── vars
│       └── main.yml
└── role_c
    ├── meta
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── tasks
    │   └── main.yml
    └── vars
        └── main.yml
```
### The playbook file
We're going to run all three roles by calling for only the last role in
the dependency chain.

`apply_roles.yml`

```yaml
---
- name: apply roles
  hosts: localhost
  
  roles:
    - role_c
```

### The dependency chain
When we call role_c, it is dependent on role_b, and role_b is dependent on
role_a


`$ cat roles/role_b/meta/main.yml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  - role: role_a
```
..
`$ cat roles/role_c/meta/main.yml`
..
```yaml
dependencies:
  - role: role_b
```

### The task files
The task file for role_a does most of the heavy lifting.
It executes debug message tasks that "sing" the lyrics.

I include a idempotency exercise that pulls on the `role_name` special
variable to craft a file in a generated `proof/` folder.

`roles/role_a/tasks/main.yml`

```yaml
- name: What role are we executing?
  debug: 
    msg: "We are running this task for {{ role_name }}"

- name: Print verse specified for this role.
  debug:
    msg: "{{ item.msg }}"
  loop: "{{ verse }}"

- name: include the chorus
  import_tasks:
    file: "{{ playbook_dir }}/roles/role_a/tasks/chorus.yml"

- name: Ensure the proof folder exists
  file:
    path: "{{ playbook_dir }}/proof/"
    state: directory
  run_once: true

- name: idempotency/proof task
  lineinfile:
    path: "{{ playbook_dir }}/proof/{{ role_name }}"
    line: "{{ role_name }} was here"
    create: yes

- name: import role_a's tasks
  import_tasks:
    file: "{{ playbook_dir }}/roles/role_a/tasks/main.yml"
- name: import role_a's tasks
  import_tasks:
    file: "{{ playbook_dir }}/roles/role_a/tasks/main.yml"
```
The task file for role_b just imports the tasks from role_a, and we
do the same thing with role_c:

`roles/role_b/tasks/main.yml`

```yaml
- name: import role_a's tasks
  import_tasks:
    file: "{{ playbook_dir }}/roles/role_a/tasks/main.yml"
```

Finally, we have a chorus.yml file that defines how we produce the chorus
and post-chorus. This file lives under role_a:

`roles/role_a/tasks/chorus.yml`

```yaml
- name: chorus
  debug:
    msg: "{{ item }}"
  loop: "{{ chorus }}"

- name: post_chorus
  debug:
    msg: "{{ post_chorus }}"
```

### The vars files
Each role contains unique lyrics from "The Wizard." The roles divide the
song into a dictionary `verse`, list `chorus`, and string `post-chorus`.

`roles/role_a/vars/main.yml`

```yaml
verse:
  - 'msg': "Misty morning, clouds in the sky"
  - 'msg': "Without warning, the wizard walks by"
  - 'msg': "Casting his shadow, weaving his spell"
  - 'msg': "Long grey cloak, tinkling bell"
chorus: 
  - "Never Talking"
  - "Justkeeps walking"
post_chorus: "Cursing his magic"
```

`roles/role_b/vars/main.yml`

```yaml
verse:
  - 'msg': "Evil power disappears"
  - 'msg': "Demons worry when the wizard is near"
  - 'msg': "He turns tears into joy"
  - 'msg': "Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by"
post_chorus: "Spreading his magic"
```

`roles/role_c/vars/main.yml`

```yaml
verse:
  - 'msg': "Sun is shining, clouds have gone by"
  - 'msg': "All the people give a happy sigh"
  - 'msg': "He has passed by, giving his sign"
  - 'msg': "Left all the people feeling so fine"
```

### The results
When we run the playbooks the first time:

`results.txt`

Let's grep the results for `"msg"`:

`cat results.txt | grep \"msg\"`

```yaml

    "msg": "Without warning, the wizard walks by"
    "msg": "Casting his shadow, weaving his spell"
    "msg": "Long grey cloak, tinkling bell"
    "msg": "Never Talking"
    "msg": "Just keeps walking"
    "msg": "Cursing his magic"
    "msg": "We are running this task for role_b"
    "msg": "Evil power disappears"
    "msg": "Demons worry when the wizard is near"
    "msg": "He turns tears into joy"
    "msg": "Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by"
    "msg": "Never Talking"
    "msg": "Just keeps walking"
    "msg": "Spreading his magic"
    "msg": "We are running this task for role_c"
    "msg": "Sun is shining, clouds have gone by"
    "msg": "All the people give a happy sigh"
    "msg": "He has passed by, giving his sign"
    "msg": "Left all the people feeling so fine"
    "msg": "Never Talking"
    "msg": "Just keeps walking"
    "msg": "Spreading his magic"

```
this gives us just the debug messages.

## The Advantages of Roles
Roles give us a mechanism for creating complex interactions between objects
(tasks, variables, handlers, etc.) and artifacts (generated files, compiled
software, processed data sets, etc.)

We divide our work into reusable chunks, so we can adapt and extend configuration: as needed, or on-demand. By reusing configuration code when
possible, we ensure that we can adapt our code efficiently because we can make
sweeping changes that will stay consistent across groups of systems.

### Configuration management
Configuration management is when you can push out configuration changes from
a centralized platform to client systems. When configuration is modified, the
configuration will be put back into compliance the next time it's state is 
check in on.

Ansible's role features allow us to build things that work at a wider scale. 
Design flexible roles that install services that routinely go together.

We assemble configuration that works together in modular roles. Using
ansible, we can assess and correct whether the systems meet expactions for
all our roles, and we can use variables and tags to specialize things further.

### Ideas for roles:
We could develop a ton of roles, and have the ability to adapt to a broad
range of computer use cases:

- common: generic Debian configuration
- xfce_desk: Configured xfce4 desktop environment
- gnome_desk: Configured gnome desktop environment
- nvidia: Configure nvidia GPU support.
- python: Configure generic Python execution environment
- pythondev: Configure python development environment
- web: configure apache and/or nginx.
- db_mysql: Configure MySQL database
- db_postgre: Configure PostgreSQL 
- apps_vscode: Configure vscode
- apps_eclipse: Configure eclipse
- apps_math: Configure mathematics applications
- apps_twod: Configure 2D design software
- apps_threed: Configure 3D design software
- libs_ai: Configure AI development libraries

## Tips for Building roles:
### Design generic tasks and flexible variable files
Design standarized tasks that apply configuration as specified in a roles'
variables. For example, build a loop that installs a list of services and
restarts the system daemons for you if your configuration files change.

### --list-tasks
The ansible-playbook option `--list-tasks` is indespesable for ensuring your
roles are triggering the tasks that you want. It's also good for debugging
tags!

### Honor the D.R.Y. principle
Repeating a task all over makes updating your approach arduous. If each task
is generic as possible and only defined once, you can quickly iterate and
implement features.

### Idempotency is your friend.
Idempotency is when your tasks are designed to only trigger when configuration
changes. Tasks that lack idempotency will run every time, even if they have
been previously applied.

If you have a bunch of tasks that lack idempotency in a dependency role,
you'll multiple the number of unnecessary tasks being executed every play.
Roles are great, but layering configuration on top of configuration can lead
to really slow plays if you are waiting on a ton of unnecesary tasks to return
exit codes.

Efficient roles will maximize task idempotency.
