# The Dual-Boot Dillema

## The Labs
I have the privilege of working with about 200 desktop computer systems.
Some computers are Windows, some are Linux, and we have a handful of dual-boot
systems. We maintain the entire lab environment, network services, and .

Maintaining a lab environment is crafting the secret configuration management
formula and applying it to computers en-masse on a routine basis. Developing, 
maintaining, and applying configuration management code is conducting an orchestra of
rackmounted servers, enterprise switches, desktops computers, and operating systems.

Our systems live on hardware, virtual machines, and containers. We use a code versining
control systems with continuous delivery and integration pipelines. The end result is
a relatively polished desktop user experience. We install software that's required for
lab sections and research.

## The Operating Systems

In the year 2023, Windows 10 is creeping towards the end of it's security patched
lifecycle. After 2025, Windows 10 becomes a massive security vulnerability. It
becomes a static largely unmaintained product that Microsoft will stay out of
unless something super aweful effects too many legacy systems, and they push a
few more patches.

### Oh Snap!
Ubuntu Jammy is the new LTS, and Snaps are getting bigger all the time. What are
Snaps? Snaps are a fantastic way to containerize an application in a largely
unconfigurable fashion as a way to make code easier to distribute between disparent
Linux distributions. For a standalone desktop computer, they are fantastic way
to make software run.

For computers with network mounted storage drives,
