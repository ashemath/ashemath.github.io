What is Linux?
---------------
Linux is a product of open-source initiatives, old-school Unix inspiration, and 
a kernel originally authored by Linus Torvalds. Linux itself is not an Operating System.

Rather, Linux is a kernel that people build their "distributions" around. A
distribution is a curated collection of tools that supports the linux kernel.

Companies or organizations publish their Linux distributions and may offer service
contracts or charge licensing fees for expansive use and/or production features.

Favorite Distributions:
-------------------------------
For a Desktop system, I like to have lots of options for Desktop Environments,
good driver support, and ample troubleshooting documentation:

In ranked order, my top 3 favorite distributions for Desktops:

1. Debian
2. Fedora
3. Ubuntu

For a headless server, I am focused on getting something installed. I consider
the compatibility with my use case, and I go with an option that I like that
fits software requirements. For example, to leverage someone's container
orchestration framework, I might need Redhat-based linux, so I might run
Rocky. If I want to try "devstack", I probaby want to run Ubuntu.

Dual-boot Lifestyle
--------------------
I work, study, and game with Linux, but I share computers with a household of
people who prefer a Windows environment for gaming and casual use. I need Windows
on anything I own with a GPU, but I have learned to enjoy the freedom Linux
distributions offer for the desktop use case.

My first dual-boot
____________________
My first experience with Linux was when I tried a live boot Fedora CD-ROM.

I tried out the desktop interface, and it took me a few days exploring the
interface to decide it was something I would want in a dual-boot.

I booted back into Windows XP, and I shrank back my C:\\ partition. I booted off of
my CD, and I set about installing linux on that 20GB that I shrank off of Windows.
Having a permanent installation meant that I could tackle problems with the
configuration, and my changes would survive a reboot.

Eventually, I even got the 1440x900 resolution to work! It was neat, but I was
more into playing World of Warcraft on Windows than exploring Fedora at the time.

How I Use dual-Boot today
__________________________
9 out of 10 times I sit down at my laptop, I will want to run Linux, but it's
nice to keep Windows happy for everyone else to enjoy use of the hardware.

I have a dual boot on my Dell gaming laptop. I have a 100GB ext4 partition
on the "storage" SSD that I install Ubuntu on.

Dual-boot gives me the option to play games on Windows while still having a full
Linux environment available when I need it. While I love me some Linux, gaming is
a first-class experience on Windows.

While Linux has come a long way by means of supporting big game titles, some
things require addditional tools like Wine. Even if you get things working with
Wine, you have just mucked about with your neat Linux system to run something that
"just works" on Windows.
