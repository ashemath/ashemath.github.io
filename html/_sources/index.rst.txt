I work as a System and Network Administrator for a Public University. Our small team of Administrators manage 150+ Desktop systems, infrastructure hosts, and a range of workloads.

We deploy onto baremetal, virtual machines, and containers. My specialized role on the team is Network administration, but I participate in a wide range of projects including infrastructure monitoring,
public documentation, hardware troubleshooting, and the delivery of various networked services. Lately, I have learned how to manage both Linux and Windows systems with Ansible.

From my Linux workstation, I can image and configure lab machines in either Windows or Linux, at scale.
I manage network equipment, host network configuration, and network services with SSH and Ansible.

I share my personal training/development environment on Github. In my code, I deploy virtual machines, 
and I automate configuration of services; this collection of code serves as a repository of system
administration ideas, testing ground for new configuration, and display of my skill development.

Prior to working for the University, I taught Linux and Cisco Networking for Job Corps as the instructor/designer of their "Advanced IT" trade.

Why Bill the Wizard?
---------------------
Computers and networking technologies drive solutions to problems in our daily lives,
yet the goal of our implementations with these technologies center around making them as transparent to the end user as possible.
The work is all about making the things happen "automagically."
The end-user wants to click a link and have all of these amazing things happen, without needing insight into the underlying configuration 
that's necessary to do the thing.

Complex technical solutions to real-world problems often include: 

- Cable and Power management
- Network Device Configuration
- Host Networking Configuration
- Hypervising and Containerization
- File Storage services
- System Updates and Backups
- Git
- CI/CD Pipelines
- Configuration Management
- Container image registry
- Application Development (Multiple Languages, Multiple Platforms, Multiple Architectures)
- Application Configuratio
- Application Deployment

I strive to be someone who understands things at this level: a wizard. Someone who invokes daemons and memorizes incantations.
There is always more to learn. Things change over time, both subtle changes and major re-imaginings of entire system processes.
Mastering the art of System Administration is site specific, Operating System specific, scale-specific, network specific, and
user demands change over time: week to week, month to month, day-to-day, and hour-to-hour.

Managing a collection of computer systems is really fun. A customized faculty research workstation requires a different touch than a general 
purpose lab machine. Infrastructure hosts require a whole other skillset. Managing all of these systems in concert is a study of
the art of system administration.

I understand that I'll toil for decades learning these things, and I am fine with that.

Teacher and Computer/Network Expert
-------------------------------------
I had a 10 year career as an educator before changing fields to work as a System/Network Admin. After College, I taught Adult Basic Education Mathemmatics for Job Corps
After about 4 years, our campus shut down between contractors, and I went to work as an Elementary teacher.

After teaching 5th and 6th grade for the two years, I went back to work at Job Corps as an IT instructor.
I supervised studies in Game Development, Web Development, Graphic Design, Computer Help Desk, Networking, and Linux System Administration. 
During my tenure as an IT instructor, I achieved CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, and Linux+, and the Cisco CCNA in June 2022.
