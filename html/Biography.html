<h2>The Origin Story<a class="headerlink" href="#the-origin-story" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am Bill Ashe, and I am the Wizard. My parental units brought me online in the late 80’s. I spent my early days playing NES, running awful games on MS-DOS, and breaking Windows 95 trying to find Beavis and Butthead videos on a 56k modem. Rich childhood experiences playing with technology fostered a passion for computing that has kept me entertained all these years.</p>
<section id="the-student">
<h3>The Student<a class="headerlink" href="#the-student" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>I survived childhood poverty and trauma: leaving home at the age of sixteen to find my way in the world. I enrolled at Cascades Job Corps in Sedro Woolley, Washington. At Job Corps, staff encouraged me to broaden my ambitions; they supported me in going to community college, and at 19 years old, I was accepted into the Elementary Education program at Western Washington University.</p>
<p>I found studying Elementary Education to be very rewarding. Teaching pushed my social and communication abilities to the limit. I knew I had deficits in these areas, and I was determined to get better. Looking back, I see that I was trying to fit in. Teaching is a socially focused role with high levels of publicly visible responsibilities. Everyone is waiting for you to take a lead. I had panic attacks between my classes. I got super frustrated with how nervous I was, all the time.</p>

<h3>The Teacher<a class="headerlink" href="#the-teacher" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>I finished at WWU in 2012, earning a Bachelors Degree in Elementary Mathematics and endorsements to teach both grades K-8 and Secondary Mathematics.</p>
<p>In 2012, I became a Father, and working became a priority for me. Luckily, I found an opportunity at Cascades Job Corps, the same place that I had gone to as a teen. I taught mathematics in a Adult Basic Education setting for about 4 years at Cascades until an exciting pilot program was announced: our Center would be the focus of a national push to modernize Job Corps.</p>
<p>Our Center would be temporarily shutting down to transition to the new program, so I went to work as a full-time elementary teacher for almost two years. I struggled a lot as a Elementary Teacher: I walked into that classroom excited to do my best, but the chaos and pressure pushed me further than I had ever imagined.</p>

<h3>The Game Development Instructor<a class="headerlink" href="#the-game-development-instructor" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In 2017, I came back to Cascades Job Corps to supervise college students enrolled in Media and Interactive Technology (MIT) classes at Skagit Valley College. As the students in my class progressed, I did my best to try out their assignments, and I learned a lot about Web Design and Adobe Creative Cloud. In addition to the MIT coursework, I studied the Unity game engine, C#, Java, and Python. Many of our students succeeded at SVC, and achieved their Associates in Arts or Program Certificate. The pilot program moved to a phase where we were no longer enrolling college students in 2019, and we began to discuss moving onto another role: instructor for a new “Advanced IT” course. In Spring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic brought our MIT course to a halt, along with the rest of the World.</p>

<h3>The Advanced IT Instructor<a class="headerlink" href="#the-advanced-it-instructor" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When I came back to work after the long period of working from home, I began prepping for my new role of “Advanced IT” instructor. We had collected an assortment of enterprise firewalls, servers, switches, NAS units, Uninterruptable Power Supplies, business class network connection with a small static IP range. All of this was waiting for a knowledgeable person to set up a local network infrastructure, but I had only passed my CompTIA A+, and I had never worked on a server before.</p>
<p>Teaching Advanced IT topics in a Job Corps setting is challenging. We have a solid enterprise network operating throughout campus, complete with WIFI and up-to-date Windows 10 computers, but the production Job Corps system expressly forbids students from making any administrative changes on the computers. I decided that we would need to build our own Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, separate from the Job Corps production system, and I set about a course of study that would lead me to realizing this goal.</p>
